# DevClub Summer of Code 2023

## Backend Development

### What Backend Development Entails?
Backend development encompasses the creation and maintenance of the server-side components that power web applications. It involves designing, developing, and managing the logic, databases, and infrastructure required to handle data processing, user authentication, business logic, and integrations. Backend developers work with programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or Node.js to build robust APIs, implement server-side functionalities, and ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend. They focus on performance, security, and scalability, enabling the seamless functioning of web applications and delivering a reliable and efficient user experience.

### What we'll be building?
This year the theme for DevClub Summer of Code is [e-commerce](https://github.com/devclub-iitd/summer-of-code-2023#theme-and-project)! We'll be building an e-commerce website from scratch. For the website, we will have a frontend and a backend. The frontend will be built using React and the backend will be built using Django. We'll be using Django REST Framework to build the API for our website. We'll be using PostgreSQL as our database.
