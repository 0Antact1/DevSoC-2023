## Frontend Development: Week 1 

This week, we'll learn how to build a simple website using HTML and CSS. 

### Introduction

#### HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup for web pages. A markup language is an encoding system which consists of a set of symbols which when inserted in text control it's structure. HTML is based on markup meta languages XML and SGML. Meta languages are used to define a documents structure and the relation between it's parts rather than how it will be displayed. Thus colors, padding, position, etc are rarely specified in HTML. 

#### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS can be used to separately control layout, color and font of different elements. 

It can be added in the HTML file (inline) or be linked separately in a style sheet. 
In case of multiple styles, in line take preference over an external style sheet. 

### Task

In this task you have to implement a basic [figma design] (https://www.figma.com/file/N7yxyydXHp3mFS5jW8N0Bl/E-commerce-(Website)-(Community)?type=design&t=3bpoeKePi2CJRpBb-1) using HTML and CSS. 

Create a navbar with 3 links and a logo. The links should be white and turn light blue on clicking them. We're only concerned with the Home page right now but we'll be adding routing and linking other sites very soon ;)

Create a carousel and add the image with two buttons.
Bonus: Use Javascript to turn this into a slide show 

Add a section heading ("What we do to help our customers in the digital era") with 3 cards. The cards should have an image, some text, and a link.
Hint: Use absolute positioning, and don't forget to use div tag.

Add a section heading ("How it works") with 3 cards, this time side by side. This is meant to help the customers, so keep your instructions short and clear.

In the "What our clients say" section, you can add a photo of yourself or your friend and write a review beside it. Don't forget to add the buttons, as we will need it when we learn JavaScript

In the last section, make a footer and add the logo with your name.
